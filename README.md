# Homework 8

# Purpose

- This should be a Firebase project so make sure you create your project first and then start coding.

# Task

- For this homework assignment, you will be making the Jungle Cook website, and making it fully functional. This site must be fully responsive for desktop and tablets, 1024Ã—768, and must be a full working CRUD application. Assets for this project can be found in Files > Jungle Cook. In this folder you will find everything you need.
- You must have user feedback i.e. have alerts showing when loading data or something happens so the user knows something is wrong.
- You will be using JSON for the data for this project. This will be a JSON file from a local folder.
- Points will be taken off for not having your site responsive and not having user feedback. Also, if you don't have a fully functioning CRUD application you will have points deducted.
- For the CRUD you must be able to create a recipe, delete the recipe, display all recipes and update a recipe. If you can not do any of that, then this is not a CRUD application.
- Make sure you get your styling done first. Then your functionality.
- Have your project on Github with a Full README file description of your project. I want full details about what the application does and how it works.
- Deploy this to Firebase and to Github as well. Remember to add to your Readme file and put the link to Firebase link inside the Readme file.

# Reflection

- To be completely honest, this project has been a complete and total disaster on my end.
- The site is fully responsive.
- In its current state, the site is somewhat functional, allowing the user to create and display new recipes, and the user is able to delete recipes from the site.
- For errors that I could not find the solution towards, I could not append the data used in recipes, so I was unable to program a dynamic detail page, only showing theoretically what it would look like.
- I also had trouble using firebase during this project, with it completely corrupting my project, and making me restart the project 3 times.
- Ultimately, I believe that this site is okay, and I plan on adding complete functionality to it in the near future.
